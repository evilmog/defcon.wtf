The DEFCON MUD started out originally as the DerbyCon MUD.

The DerbyCon MUD started out because EvilMog broke his ankle paragliding and was stuck on the couch for 3 months. He used to play this game called CoreMUD, the game was broken so he logged into every room and copied it, and then used an LPC (interpreted c++ variant) code generator (python scripts) to code a duplicate game. 

The game was well recieved and this became an event during the pandemic.

EvilMog later took over coremud, starting out as an admin and later taking full ownership.

Here we are today, 2x MUD's, 2 different codebases, similar content. Are you ready for shenanigans?
